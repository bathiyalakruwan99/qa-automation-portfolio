# Contract Test Case Automation

## Purpose

Prompts, CSV templates, and analysis notes used to generate contract verification test cases automatically. These files help QA engineers capture pricing, flagdown, and invoice scenarios without writing each test manually.

## Key Contents

- `try 1/` – Initial prompt guides plus `contract_verification_test_case.csv`.
- `try 2/` – Updated analysis report for prompt-driven reviews.
- `try3/` – Invoice-calculation scenarios and supporting notes.
- `ty 4/` – Finalized CSV/Markdown pairs for flagdown and partial flagdown calculations, plus the `test_case_csv_prompt.md` template.

## How to Use

1. Start with the latest prompts (in `ty 4/`) to instruct the agent on how to build CSV rows.
2. Generate or edit cases in Markdown, then convert them to CSV using the same structure.
3. Use previous iterations (`try 1-3`) as historical references when new contract rules arise.
