"8. Perform cross-system data consistency check:
Compare contract, invoice, and running sheet for:
- Organization/Customer alignment
- Contract references  
- Service provider details
- Date consistency","All three systems should show:

Test Summary,All verification steps completed successfully with 100% data consistency across contract-invoice-running sheet systems,,,,,
Overall Result,PASS - Contract verification successful with no discrepancies found,,,,,
,,,,,,
Key Findings:,,,,,,
1. Contract Type: Flag Down contract correctly implemented across all systems,,,,,,
"2. Pricing Structure: Transportation fee (LKR 500,000) + Fixed costs (600) + Demurrage (3,200) = Total LKR 503,800",,,,,,
"3. Data Integrity: Perfect consistency in customer name, contract references, and service provider details",,,,,,
4. System Integration: Seamless data flow from contract creation through invoice generation to running sheet,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Recommendations:,,,,,,
1. Continue using this verification process for future contract validations,,,,,,
2. Consider automating cross-system data consistency checks,,,,,,
3. Document this test case as a template for similar contract types,,,,, ,
