Changes save/update successfully; 4. No red banner appears (no Invalid leave time error); 5. No blocking occurs during save; 6. Times persist as valid values; 7. Downstream times remain unchanged since duration kept constant,Medium,QA Team,Ready for Test,Persistence,,Container Management task editing without triggering false errors,Container Management,

Case A: Change L2 Arrival to later valid value and save; 2. Case B: Change L2 Arrival to ≥ L2 Leave and save; 3. Case C: Change L2 Arrival to < (L1 Leave + transit) and save; 4.
