# Test Case Management & CSV Import Rules

## 🎯 PRIMARY CONTEXT
You are working with test case management systems (primarily Testiny) and CSV file imports. Follow these rules for optimal test case creation, formatting, and import compatibility.

## 📋 CSV FORMATTING RULES

### Character Limits (CRITICAL - Testiny Import)
- **Actual Result**: MAX 255 characters
- **Description**: MAX 500 characters  
- **Precondition**: MAX 1000 characters
- **Steps**: MAX 2000 characters
- **Expected Result**: MAX 1000 characters
- **Test Data**: MAX 500 characters

### CSV Structure Requirements
1. **Always include Module column** as first column for organization
2. **Remove internal line breaks** - use semicolon (;) separation instead
3. **Avoid nested quotes** within CSV fields
4. **Remove special characters** (emojis, excessive symbols)
5. **Use simple text formatting** for universal compatibility

### Field Formatting Standards
```csv
Module,Title,Description,Precondition,Steps,Expected Result,Priority,Owner,Status,Type,Bug,Test Data,Folder,Actual Result
```

## 🧪 TEST CASE WRITING STANDARDS

### Title Format (UPDATED)
**GPS Manager Test Cases:**
- `[GPS Manager][GPS Insights][Report Name]Verify that User can [Action] successfully`
- Examples: 
  - `[GPS Manager][GPS Insights][Closest Approach Time Report]Open Closest Approach Report Page`
  - `[GPS Manager][GPS Insights][Vehicle Status Report]Execute Search`
  - `[GPS Manager][GPS Insights][Location Time Stamp Report]Download Report`

**Other Modules:**
- `[Module][Feature]Verify that User can [Action] successfully`
- Examples: 
  - `[Job Summary][Widget Display]Verify that User can view Job Summary widget as permanent component on dashboard successfully`
  - `[GPS Manager][Vehicle Search]Verify that User can search multiple vehicles successfully`
  - `[GPS Manager][Geofence Creation]Verify that User can create geofence with location successfully`

### Precondition Format
- Numbered list with semicolon separation
- Format: `1. condition; 2. condition; 3. condition; 4. condition`
- Keep concise but complete

### Steps Format  
- Sequential numbered steps with semicolon separation
- **STANDARD: 7 steps with 7 corresponding expected results** (proven optimal)
- Format: `1. locate; 2. action; 3. wait; 4. verify; 5. check; 6. confirm; 7. validate`
- Each step should have immediate expected result for validation

### Expected Result Format
- Clear numbered success criteria
- Format: `1. criteria; 2. criteria; 3. criteria; 4. criteria; 5. criteria; 6. criteria; 7. criteria`
- Focus on measurable outcomes

## 🎯 STEP-BY-STEP EXPECTED RESULT PAIRING METHODOLOGY

### Core Principle (PROVEN EFFECTIVE)
**Each test step should have its corresponding expected result that can be validated immediately after performing that step.**

Based on successful implementation across 63+ test cases, this methodology significantly improves:
- **Immediate Validation**: Each step verifiable right after execution
- **Clear Failure Identification**: Issues pinpointed to specific steps  
- **Better Traceability**: Each action has defined expected outcome
- **Enhanced Test Execution**: Reduced ambiguity during testing

### Standard Implementation Format (7-Step Model)
```
Steps Column:
1. Locate/Navigate to element; 2. Perform primary action; 3. Wait for processing; 4. Verify immediate response; 5. Check data accuracy; 6. Confirm completion; 7. Validate final state

Expected Result Column:
1. Element is visible and accessible; 2. Action triggers expected process; 3. Processing completes successfully; 4. Response appears as expected; 5. Data displays accurately; 6. Process completion confirmed; 7. Final state achieved correctly
```

### Implementation Guidelines (Field-Tested)
1. **Match Quantity**: Ensure same number of steps and expected results (7 is optimal)
2. **Sequential Logic**: Each expected result should logically follow its step
3. **Immediate Validation**: Expected results should be verifiable right after the step
4. **Progressive Flow**: Steps should build upon each other logically
5. **Clear Outcomes**: Each expected result should be measurable/observable
6. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 7 steps provide thorough test coverage without being excessive

### Real Implementation Example (GPS Manager)
**Original Format:**
```
Steps: "1. Select vehicle; 2. Click search; 3. Verify results"
Expected: "Vehicle results are displayed"
```

**Enhanced Step-by-Step Paired Format:**
```
Steps: "1. Locate vehicle search input field; 2. Enter CAO 8070 in search field; 3. Press enter or click search button; 4. Verify CAO 8070 results appear; 5. Enter WJ 3500 in search field; 6. Press enter or click search button; 7. Confirm both vehicles are listed in results"

Expected Results: "1. Vehicle search field is visible and accessible; 2. CAO 8070 is entered correctly in search field; 3. Search action is triggered for CAO 8070; 4. CAO 8070 search results display with vehicle information; 5. WJ 3500 is entered correctly in search field; 6. Search action is triggered for WJ 3500; 7. Both vehicles CAO 8070 and WJ 3500 are listed with complete data"
```

### Quality Validation Checklist (Proven Effective)
- ✅ Each step has a corresponding expected result
- ✅ Expected results are immediately verifiable
- ✅ Logical progression from step 1 through step 7
- ✅ Clear, measurable outcomes defined
- ✅ Professional QA terminology maintained
- ✅ Character limits respected in both columns
- ✅ All 7 steps contribute meaningfully to test coverage

### Actual Result Optimization
**When over 255 characters, apply these shortcuts:**
- `CRITICAL FAILURE` instead of `CRITICAL FUNCTIONALITY FAILURE`
- Remove redundant words: `does not` → `doesn't`
- Use abbreviations: `Control Tower` → `CT`
- Combine similar issues: `Multiple issues: X; Y; Z format`
- Remove examples if space needed
- Keep JIRA ticket references

## 🚨 COMMON FIXES

### Character Limit Violations
```
// Before (over 255)
"MAJOR UI ISSUES FOUND: Completed Tab - Column spacing misaligned font inconsistencies; Delivery in Progress Tab - Progress bar height/color inconsistent; Notified Tab - Driver and vehicle columns wrap/overflow"

// After (under 255)  
"MAJOR UI ISSUES: Column spacing misaligned; Progress bars inconsistent; Text wrapping in Notified tab; Date format issues"
```

### Line Break Issues
```
// Before (problematic)
"1. User has credentials
2. User logged in
3. Dashboard accessible"

// After (CSV compatible)
"1. User has credentials; 2. User logged in; 3. Dashboard accessible"
```

### Quote Escaping
```
// Before (problematic)
"Click "Submit" button and verify "Success" message"

// After (CSV safe)
"Click Submit button and verify Success message appears"
```

## 🏗️ PROFESSIONAL QA STANDARDS

### Test Case Structure (Based on Senior QA Best Practices)
- **Owner**: Always specify (e.g., "QA Team")
- **Template**: Use "Steps" for functional tests
- **Priority**: Critical/High/Medium/Low based on business impact
- **Status**: "Ready for Test" for new cases
- **Type**: Functional/UI-UX/Data Validation/Navigation/Accessibility

### Bug Reference Format
- Single bug: `PB-2307`
- Multiple bugs: `PB-2304, PB-2305`
- Leave empty if no related bugs

### Test Data Format
- Environment details: `Login: username; Password: password; Environment: URL`
- Expected values: `Expected format: DD MMM YYYY; Timeout: 5 seconds`
- Test scenarios: `Jobs with percentages: 8%, 14%, 33%, 55%, 100%`

## 📊 XLSX TO CSV CONVERSION WORKFLOW

### Batch Processing Approach
1. **Create Review Files First**
   - Generate markdown review file for each XLSX before conversion
   - Document current structure, column mappings, and planned transformations
   - Identify data consistency requirements across files

2. **Systematic File Processing**
   - Process files one by one with clear progress tracking
   - Convert XLSX to temporary CSV for analysis
   - Apply professional formatting and data standardization
   - Clean up temporary files after successful conversion

3. **Module and Data Standardization**
   - Standardize module names across all files (e.g., "GPS Manager")
   - Maintain consistent test data (vehicle IDs: CAO-8070, WJ-3500)
   - Apply uniform date formats and reference standards
   - Ensure consistent vehicle, location, and job references

### Column Mapping Guidelines
- **Common Mappings**: "Step Description" → "Description", "Tooltip Example" → "Test Data"
- **Remove Unnecessary**: "Test Case ID", "Scenario ID" (not needed for import)
- **Add Missing**: "Owner" → "QA Team", "Folder" → Module name, "Status" → "Ready for Test"
