# Agent and MCP Works

AI-powered QA workflows using Model Context Protocol (MCP) for automation. Agent-based testing and data analysis workflows.

---

## What This Is

Collection of prompts, scripts, and workflows for using AI agents (MCP) in QA processes. Automates repetitive analysis and data processing tasks.

**MCP = Model Context Protocol** - Framework for AI agents to interact with systems and data

---

## What's Included

### Client Data Analysis
- `clientD-job-analysis/` - Job export analysis workflows
- `client-load-archives/` - Historical load validation

### Invoice Workflows
- `invoice-validation-reports/` - Invoice reconciliation automation
- `invoice-completion-audit/` - Completeness checking
- `invoice-count-inspector/` - Cross-source counting

### Job Analytics
- `job-percentage-analytics/` - Progress tracking automation
- `job-progress-checker-mcp/` - In-progress job validation

---

## How It Works

Uses AI agents (via MCP) to:
1. Read data from various sources
2. Apply validation logic
3. Generate reports
4. Flag anomalies
5. Cross-reference data

**Example workflow:**
```
Export data → MCP agent reads → Applies rules → Generates report
```

## Use Cases

- Automated invoice validation
- Job completion auditing
- Cross-system data reconciliation
- Progress percentage tracking
- Data consistency checking

---

## Tech Stack

- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- AI agents (ChatGPT, Claude)
- Python scripts for data processing
- Prompt engineering
- Custom validation rules

---

## Note

This is more experimental/advanced automation using emerging AI agent technology (MCP). Each subfolder has its own README with specific workflows.
