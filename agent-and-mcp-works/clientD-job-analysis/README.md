# ClientD Job Analysis Prompts

## Overview

Reference prompts, notes, and job lists for answering ClientD job inquiries through MCP or agent workflows. Use these files when analyzing completion status, missing jobs, or platform-export issues for ClientD.

## Contents

- `clientD_job_reference.md` – Master list of ClientD jobs pulled from the platform.
- `platform_completed_jobs.md` – Jobs confirmed as completed.
- `platform_load_names_only.md` – Quick lookup table of load names without metadata.
- `platform_data_collection_prompt.md` – Agent prompt template for gathering new data.
- `missing_job_entries.md` – Outstanding jobs that still need attention.
- `notes.txt` – Scratchpad for analyst comments during MCP sessions.

## Usage

Import one or more markdown files into the agent session and follow the instructions in `platform_data_collection_prompt.md` to ask structured questions. Use `missing_job_entries.md` when reconciling the reference list with the platform export.
