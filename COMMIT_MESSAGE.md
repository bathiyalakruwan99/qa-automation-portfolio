# Initial commit: QA Automation Portfolio

Professional QA automation tools and frameworks built during 2+ years of experience at Haulmatic Technologies and IFS R&D International.

## Featured Projects

### GPS Testing Suite
- Simulates 1000+ GPS devices without physical hardware
- JavaScript, Leaflet.js, OpenStreetMap, real-time APIs
- Handles concurrent API requests with queue management
- Staggered device startup and throttled map updates

### Route Optimizer
- Next.js TSP solver with 2-opt and 3-opt algorithms
- Web Workers for non-blocking computation
- LRU cache (80 entries) for route metrics
- Supports 50+ locations with real road distances (OSRM)

### Excel Validator
- Python desktop tool with Tkinter GUI
- Auto-corrects Excel files before TMS upload
- Reduced customer upload errors by 50%
- Handles duplicates, validates districts, standardizes formats

### AI Test Case Generator
- MCP integration (Jira + Figma) for requirement gathering
- RTMS mind mapping for test coverage visualization
- AI-powered test case generation with manual validation
- 90% time reduction (2-4 hours → 30 minutes)

## Technical Stack
